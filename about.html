Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location
and time. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology
to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place.

Once calculated manually based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky conditions or cloud cover, 
weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account.[1] Human input is still required to 
pick the best possible model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model
performance, and knowledge of model biases.

The inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations
that describe the atmosphere, the land, and the ocean, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete 
understanding of atmospheric and related processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between the current time and the
time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps narrow the
error and provide confidence in tforecast.
